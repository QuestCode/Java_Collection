3. Extend the class LinkedListClass by adding the following operations:
	a. Find and delete the node with the smallest info in the list. (Delete only the first
	occurrence.Traverse the list only once.) Call the method implementing this operation
	deleteSmallest and include it as an abstract method in the class
	LinkedListClass.Write the definition of this method for the class
	UnorderedLinkedList.Also, write a program to test your method.
	
	b. Find and delete all the occurrences of a given info from the list. (Traverse the list
	only once.) Call the method implementing this operation deleteAll and include
	it as an abstract method in the class LinkedListClass.Write the definition
	of this method for the class UnorderedLinkedList.Also, write a program to
	test your method.
